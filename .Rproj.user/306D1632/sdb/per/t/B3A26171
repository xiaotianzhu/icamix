Hunter\nMaintainer: Xiaotian Zhu <xiaotian.zhu@abbvie.com>\nDescription: The icamix package provides R functions as well as a C++ library which facilitate the estimation of ICA mixture models. We have developed and implemented the NSMM-ICA algorithm that currently integrates npEM and Fast-ICA for non-parametric estimation of ICA mixture models. We will continue to build in algorithms that interweave the EM step with other types of ICA techniques.\nSuggests: mixtools\nLicense: GPL-2 | GPL-3\nImports: Rcpp (>= 0.11.5)\nLinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo\n",
